# A PYTHON SCRIPT TO DOWNLOAD FILES FROM DROPBOX USING dropbox MODULE

# dropbox Module is Python SDK for integrating with Dropbox API v2. Compatible with
# Python 2.7 & 3.4+
# The module can be installed using the command - pip install dropbox

# To use Dropbox API, a new app has to be registered in Dropbox App Console. Follow the below steps
# 1 - Login to the following link - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
# 2 - After signing in click on Create App.
# 3 - In the next page make the following selections
#   1. Choose an API
#       Select Dropbox API
#   2. Choose the type of access you need
#       Select Full Dropbox â€“ Access to all files and folders in a user's Dropbox.
#   3. Name your app
#       Give a name to your APP
# 4 - Click on Create App
# 5 - In the next page, click on Generate, to generate ACCESS TOKEN

# Importing the necessary packages
import os
import dropbox

# In order to make calls to the API, an instance of the Dropbox object has to be created.
# Accessing the Dropbox account with the access token
client = dropbox.Dropbox('YOUR ACCESS TOKEN')

# SET YOUR DOWNLOAD PATH
